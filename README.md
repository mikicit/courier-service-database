## Description

A small semester project composed of a series of assignments (6 tasks) for the [Database Systems](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/education/bk/predmety/50/10/p5010606.html) course at [CTU in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/). This project involves designing a database for a courier service (in a highly simplified form).

The goal of the project was to go through the process from conceptual database design to implementing a CRUD application using ORM.

Project stages:

1. Topic Description
2. Conceptual Model (ER)
3. Relational Model
4. SQL Queries 1
5. SQL Queries 2
6. ORM
